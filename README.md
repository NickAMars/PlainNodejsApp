Creating a Restful Api

This api while be able to send sms messages to user.
Create a new User.
Give the User a token to validate them when so
that they can use get, put, delete methods for there account.
Store information using a file system.
I will not be using external npm libraries for this app.
This objective of this is to make me appriciate the use of external library such as mongoose and user authen which could be use to speed up development much better.
